LegalKernel.Bridge.Admissible — Workstream C.0
(`docs/planning/ethereum_integration_plan.md` §7.0).

The bridge-aware admissibility predicate
(`BridgeAdmissibleWith`) and entry point
(`apply_bridge_admissible_with`).

The existing kernel `Transition.pre` operates on `State`, not on
`ExtendedState` or `BridgeState`.  This means three new bridge-
specific preconditions have nowhere to live in the existing
`AdmissibleWith` predicate:

  1. **Deposit-id uniqueness** — `depositId ∉ es.bridge.consumed`
     for `Action.deposit`.
  2. **Registration first-time-only** — `KeyRegistry.lookup
     es.registry actor = none` for `Action.registerIdentity`.
  3. **Bridge-only authority** — `Action.deposit` /
     `Action.withdraw` (and `Action.registerIdentity`) must be
     signed by `bridgeActor` (which is the L1 → L2 translator's
     authority).

Workstream C.0 extends the `AdmissibleWith` predicate with three
extra conjuncts capturing these obligations, and defines a
`apply_bridge_admissible_with` entry point that consumes the
strengthened witness and additionally updates the
`ExtendedState.bridge` field via `applyActionToBridgeState`.

The strict subset:
`BridgeAdmissibleWith verify P d es st →
 Authority.AdmissibleWith verify P d es st`
makes every Phase-3 / Phase-4-prelude / Phase-6 admissibility
theorem (replay protection, nonce uniqueness, etc.) lift
transparently to the bridge layer via the
`BridgeAdmissibleWith.toAdmissibleWith` projection.

This module is **not** part of the kernel TCB.  Bugs here would
weaken the bridge's deposit-uniqueness or registration-uniqueness
guarantees but cannot violate any kernel invariant — every bridge
admissibility witness inherits the kernel's `AdmissibleWith` body
verbatim.

/-! ## Bridge-only action classification

`Action.isBridgeOnly` is `true` exactly for the action constructors
that **must** be signed by the bridge actor — namely the
L1-attested actions: `registerIdentity` (first-time identity
registration) and `deposit` (L1 deposit credit).

`withdraw` is *not* bridge-only.  Withdrawals are user-initiated:
the L2 sender signs their own withdrawal, and the deployment's
per-actor authority policy authorises the action.  The bridge
records the resulting `PendingWithdrawal` entry into its ledger
via `applyActionToBridgeState`, but does NOT need to sign the
withdrawal itself.  Workstream-C audit-1 hardening removed
`withdraw` from this set after surfacing that the original
listing forced ALL withdrawals to be bridge-actor-signed via
conjunct 8 of `BridgeAdmissibleWith` — contradicting the
user-initiated flow.  See CLAUDE.md's audit-1 changelog. -/

/-- Predicate: the action is a bridge-attested L1 → L2 action that
    must be signed by the bridge actor.  Used by
    `BridgeAdmissibleWith` conjunct 8.  Returns `true` for:

      * `registerIdentity` — first-time bridge-attested identity
        registration.
      * `deposit` — bridge-attested L1 deposit credit.
      * `depositWithFee` (Workstream GP) — bridge-attested L1
        deposit credit with user-chosen fee split AND a budget
        grant; the `bridgePolicy` AuthorityPolicy layer rejects
        non-bridge signers, and the kernel-only admission gate
        (`depositWithFee_signerCheck`) provides the matching
        defence-in-depth at the gate layer.  Including it here
        means `BridgeAdmissibleWith` ALSO requires
        `signer = bridgeActor` on the production bridge-aware
        path — three layers of agreement on the same invariant.

    Returns `false` for `withdraw` (user-initiated) and
    `topUpActionBudget` (user-initiated; user pays gas to refill
    their own action budget). -/

/-! ## applyActionToBridgeState

The bridge-side state-update helper.  For most actions this is the
identity (the bridge state is unchanged).  For `deposit` and
`depositWithFee`, the deposit-id is recorded in `consumed` with its
`(resource, total-credited-amount)` metadata.  For `withdraw`, a new
`PendingWithdrawal` entry is inserted at `nextWdId` and the counter
is bumped. -/

/-- The bridge-state effect of an action, with explicit per-action
    closure over the L2 log index.  Most actions are bridge-state-
    identity; only `deposit`, `depositWithFee`, and `withdraw` mutate
    it.

    Workstream GP closure: `.depositWithFee` also carries a `depositId`
    sourced from an L1 attestation; recording it in `consumed` is
    required to prevent bridge-aware replay of the same L1 deposit
    payload (`BridgeAdmissibleWith` conjunct 6b enforces freshness
    at admission time, and this function persists the consumption at
    apply time so subsequent admissions reject duplicates).  The
    `consumed` entry's `amount` is `userAmount + poolAmount` — the
    total credited to L2 balances — matching the deposit-accounting
    invariant that `consumed` tracks "the L2 supply expansion
    attributable to this L1 event". -/

/-! ## BridgeAdmissibleWith

The §7.0 strengthened admissibility predicate.  Inherits the five
`AdmissibleWith` conjuncts and adds four bridge-specific obligations.

Each new conjunct fires only on the relevant action variant:

  * Conjunct 6 (deposit-id uniqueness for `.deposit`) is vacuous
    for non-`deposit` actions.
  * Conjunct 6b (deposit-id uniqueness for `.depositWithFee`) is
    vacuous for non-`depositWithFee` actions.  Required by
    Workstream GP: a bridge-signed `.depositWithFee` carries an
    L1-attested `depositId`; without this conjunct the same payload
    could be admitted multiple times, re-crediting balances and
    re-granting budget on every replay.
  * Conjunct 7 (first-time registration) is vacuous for non-
    `registerIdentity` actions.
  * Conjunct 8 (bridge-only signer) only restricts the
    `isBridgeOnly` action variants
    (`.registerIdentity`, `.deposit`, `.depositWithFee`).

For non-bridge actions, `BridgeAdmissibleWith` collapses to the
underlying `AdmissibleWith` (via vacuous truth on each new
conjunct). -/

/-- The bridge-aware admissibility predicate.  Strengthens the
    Phase-3 `AdmissibleWith` with four bridge-specific obligations
    (§7.0 + Workstream GP).  Non-bridge actions discharge each new
    conjunct vacuously, so this predicate is strictly equivalent to
    `AdmissibleWith` outside the bridge surface. -/

/-! ## apply_bridge_admissible_with

The bridge-aware entry point.  Calls the Phase-3 `apply_admissible_with`
on the underlying `AdmissibleWith` witness, then additionally
updates the `ExtendedState.bridge` field for `deposit` / `withdraw`
actions.  Non-bridge actions leave the bridge field unchanged
(`applyActionToBridgeState` is the identity on them). -/

/-- The bridge-aware single-step state advance.  Equivalent to
    `apply_admissible_with` on every field except `bridge`, which
    is updated via `applyActionToBridgeState`.

    `l2LogIndex` is the logical position of this signed action in
    the deployment's log.  The runtime layer (Phase 5) tracks it as
    `RuntimeState.logIndex`; for tests / unit-of-work proofs that
    don't need a meaningful index, callers pass `0`. -/

/-! ## `apply_bridge_admissible_with_budget` (RB.2 — bridge-aware
    runtime entry combining admission + bridge state + budget gate)

The runtime entry-point analogue of `apply_admissible_with_budget`
(`Authority/SignedAction.lean`).  Threads through the GP.3.2
bounded-policy budget gate on top of `apply_bridge_admissible_with`,
which means a single call:

  * verifies the kernel-level admissibility (via the
    `BridgeAdmissibleWith` witness),
  * gates the action on the signer's epoch budget (consume-only
    path, mirroring `apply_admissible_with_budget`),
  * advances the kernel state, nonce ledger, registry, and local-
    policy table (via `apply_admissible_with`),
  * updates the bridge state for `deposit` / `withdraw` actions
    (via `applyActionToBridgeState`).

`l2LogIndex` is the runtime's view of "where this signed action sits
in the deployment's log".  For `processSignedActionWith` it equals
`rs.logIndex` (the index THIS action will be appended at; identical
to `rs.logIndex + 0` since `appendEntry` is called immediately
after); for `replayStepWith` it equals the entry's index within the
log being replayed.  The bridge state writes a `PendingWithdrawal`
record carrying this index for withdraws, so the index threads
through to L1-side withdrawal proofs (Workstream D). -/

/-- RB.2 — bridge-aware admission entry combining the four
    layers (kernel admissibility, bridge state advance, budget gate,
    L2 log-index threading).  Returns `none` exactly when the budget
    gate rejects the action; otherwise returns the fully-advanced
    `ExtendedState` (kernel + nonce + registry + local policies +
    bridge + budget) wrapped in `some`.

    Compared with the legacy `apply_admissible_with_budget`
    (`Authority/SignedAction.lean`), this entry adds the
    bridge-state mutation step and consumes the stronger
    `BridgeAdmissibleWith` witness — so deposit-id-uniqueness,
    first-time-registration, and bridge-only-signer obligations
    are all enforced atomically with the kernel-level admission.

    The legacy entry remains in source for callers that don't yet
    thread the bridge witness (none in the runtime tree post-RB.3,
    but it ships for future deployments / external integrations
    that bypass the bridge layer).

    **GP.3.2.c bridgeActor exemption (per OQ-GP-6).**  When
    `st.signer = bridgeActor`, the consume step is skipped entirely.
    Mirrors the exemption in `apply_admissible_with_budget`; both
    paths share the same upstream rationale (bridge actions are
    L1-gas-gated already). -/

/-! ## §7.0a — Post-application bridge-state invariants

After a successful `apply_bridge_admissible_with` call, the
`bridge` field reflects the action's effect:

  * Deposit: the depositId IS in `consumed` (so a replay attempt
    fails conjunct 6).  Closes the L1-deposit-replay attack:
    a malicious bridge cannot credit the same L1 deposit twice
    on L2.
  * Withdraw: a new `PendingWithdrawal` is at `nextWdId`, and
    `nextWdId` is bumped.  Closes the L2-withdraw-replay
    attack: distinct withdrawals get distinct ids.

These are the type-level statements that the bridge ledger
actually evolves under bridge-admissible application. -/
