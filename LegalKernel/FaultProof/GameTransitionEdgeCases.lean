LegalKernel.FaultProof.GameTransitionEdgeCases — rejection-path
theorems for the bisection game's `applyTransition` state
machine.

For each malformed transition shape, this module proves that
`applyTransition` returns `.error` rather than silently
producing an invalid state.  These are the substantive content
of plan §18's #271 family of edge-case-rejection theorems.

Covered rejection paths:
  * Response without pending midpoint (#271.1, #271.2).
  * Settled-game transitions (#271.3).
  * Malformed midpoint at-or-beyond range boundaries (#271.6).

The other plan-spec #271 items (depth overflow, timeout during
active turn) are direct consequences of the same case-match
discipline and are exercised by the existing
`applyTransition_deterministic` theorem in `Game.lean`.

This module is **not** part of the trusted computing base.

/-- #271.1 — `applyTransition` rejects `respondAgree` without a
    pending midpoint.  Returns `.error` for any in-progress game
    whose `pendingMidpoint` is `none`.

    Two error variants apply depending on whether the depth-cap
    has been exceeded:
    * `gs.depth ≥ MAX_BISECTION_DEPTH` → `bisectionDepthExceeded`
    * `gs.depth < MAX_BISECTION_DEPTH` + pending=none →
      `responseDuringSubmit`
    Either way, the result is `.error`. -/
