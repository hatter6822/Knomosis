# Phase 5 ABI: On-Disk and On-Wire Contracts (WU 5.10)

This document specifies the byte-level contracts the Phase-5
runtime depends on.  An external implementer (e.g. a Rust network
adaptor for WU 5.4) can reproduce a compatible client by following
this document alone.

## 1. Scope

The Phase-5 ABI covers three boundaries:

  1. **The on-disk transition log format** (WU 5.2).
  2. **The on-disk snapshot format** (WU 5.12).
  3. **The on-wire `SignedAction` and `LogEntry` formats** (the
     same as their on-disk forms; the Phase-5 implementation does
     not yet wire a network adaptor, but documents the formats so
     WU 5.4's Rust adaptor can be a drop-in.)

All multi-byte integers are encoded **little-endian** unless
otherwise noted.  The CBE (Canon Binary Encoding) format used
inside payloads is documented in `LegalKernel/Encoding/CBOR.lean`
and Genesis Plan §8.8.

## 2. The Transition Log Format

A Canon log file is a sequence of **frames**, each containing one
`LogEntry`.

### 2.1 Frame structure

```
+---------+------------+----------------------+----------+
| MAGIC   | LENGTH     | PAYLOAD (LogEntry)   | TRAILER  |
| 4 bytes | 8 LE bytes | LENGTH bytes         | 8 LE bytes|
+---------+------------+----------------------+----------+
```

Field details:

  * **MAGIC** (4 bytes): the ASCII string `"CANO"`.  Byte values:
    `0x43 0x41 0x4E 0x4F`.  Exact match required.
  * **LENGTH** (8 LE bytes): the byte count of the PAYLOAD, encoded
    as an unsigned little-endian 64-bit integer.
  * **PAYLOAD**: the canonical CBE encoding of one `LogEntry` (see
    §3 below).
  * **TRAILER** (8 LE bytes): FNV-1a-64 of the PAYLOAD bytes,
    encoded as an unsigned little-endian 64-bit integer.

### 2.2 FNV-1a-64

The FNV-1a-64 hash is computed over the PAYLOAD bytes only (NOT
over the magic / length / trailer):

```
h = 0xcbf29ce484222325
for each byte b in payload:
    h = (h XOR b.to_u64()) * 0x100000001b3   (mod 2^64)
output: h.to_le_bytes()  -- 8 bytes
```

Production deployments may replace the FNV-1a-64 trailer with
BLAKE3-256 (the first 8 bytes thereof, or the full 32 bytes — both
are documented as future migration paths).  The Phase-5 reference
implementation (`canon` / `canon-replay`) uses FNV-1a-64.

### 2.3 Validation

A reader MUST validate frames in this order:

  1. **MAGIC check.**  Reject with `badMagic` if the first 4 bytes
     don't match `"CANO"`.
  2. **LENGTH bound.**  Reject with `truncated` if fewer than
     `LENGTH + 8` bytes remain after the length field (need
     enough for payload + trailer).
  3. **PAYLOAD parse.**  Decode the payload as a `LogEntry`;
     surface the `DecodeError` directly.
  4. **TRAILER check.**  Compute FNV-1a-64 of the payload bytes
     and compare against the trailer; reject with `badTrailer`
     on mismatch.
  5. **Trailing-byte check.**  The payload decoder MUST consume
     exactly `LENGTH` bytes; surface `trailingBytes` if fewer were
     consumed.

### 2.4 Atomicity

The frame layout's design intent is *atomic-or-detectable*:

  * A complete write produces a frame that passes all five checks.
  * A torn write (writer crash mid-flush) leaves a frame that
    fails one of: MAGIC (if the crash happened before the magic
    was flushed), LENGTH (if the crash was in the length bytes),
    PAYLOAD (if the crash was inside the payload — the trailer
    won't match), or TRAILER (if the crash was inside the
    trailer).

The Phase-5 reader's `loadAndTruncate` operation walks the file
frame-by-frame, stopping at the first failure and truncating the
file to the byte offset of that frame.  Crash-consistency
acceptance: 1000 randomized crash points → 1000 successful
recoveries.

## 3. The `LogEntry` CBE Encoding

```
LogEntry := [prevHash, signedAction, postStateHash]
```

Encoded as the concatenation of:

  1. **prevHash** (CBE bytestring): the previous frame's
     `LogEntry.hash` output (8 bytes for FNV-1a-64; 32 bytes for
     BLAKE3-256 in production), OR the 32-byte `zeroHash`
     (32 zero bytes) for the very first frame's `prevHash`.
     **Variable-width contract.**  Phase 5's reference
     implementation produces 8-byte FNV-1a-64 hashes for non-seed
     entries but uses a 32-byte `zeroHash` as the seed; readers
     compare bytes verbatim (`prevHash.toList ==
     predecessor.toList`) and tolerate the width transition
     between the seed and subsequent hashes.  CBE-encoded as
     `0x02 :: <8 LE bytes length> :: <length bytes>`.  Production
     deployments using BLAKE3 produce a uniform 32-byte width
     throughout the chain.
  2. **signedAction** (CBE structure): the `SignedAction` encoding
     from §4 below.
  3. **postStateHash** (CBE bytestring): the FNV-1a-64 (8 bytes)
     or BLAKE3-256 (32 bytes) of the post-application
     `ExtendedState`'s CBE encoding.  Same shape as `prevHash`.

## 4. The `SignedAction` CBE Encoding

```
SignedAction := [action, signer, nonce, sig]
```

Encoded as the concatenation of:

  1. **action** (CBE Action; see §5).
  2. **signer** (CBE uint, 9 bytes): the actor ID as
     `0x00 :: <8 LE bytes>`.
  3. **nonce** (CBE uint, 9 bytes): the nonce as
     `0x00 :: <8 LE bytes>`.
  4. **sig** (CBE bytestring): the deployment-specific signature
     bytes.  For Ed25519, this is 64 bytes (length prefix + 64
     bytes of payload).

## 5. The `Action` CBE Encoding

The `Action` type has 8 constructors, encoded by their inductive
index (frozen — Phase 5 will not renumber).

```
Action.transfer            := 0
Action.mint                := 1
Action.burn                := 2
Action.freezeResource      := 3
Action.replaceKey          := 4
Action.reward              := 5
Action.distributeOthers    := 6
Action.proportionalDilute  := 7
```

Each Action is encoded as `<constructor uint> :: <fields>`.  For
example:

```
Action.transfer r sender receiver amount  →
  CBE-uint(0) ++ CBE-uint(r) ++ CBE-uint(sender) ++
  CBE-uint(receiver) ++ CBE-uint(amount)
```

(All five fields are 9-byte CBE uints; total transfer encoding is
`9 * 5 = 45` bytes.)

The full per-constructor table is in
`LegalKernel/Encoding/Action.lean`.

## 6. The `Snapshot` Encoding

```
Snapshot := [stateHash, encodedState, logIndex, seedHash]
```

Encoded as the concatenation of:

  1. **stateHash** (CBE bytestring, 8 bytes payload).
  2. **encodedState** (CBE bytestring, variable length): the CBE
     encoding of the `ExtendedState`, length-prefixed as a
     bytestring (so a snapshot reader can skip past it without
     parsing).
  3. **logIndex** (CBE uint, 9 bytes).
  4. **seedHash** (CBE bytestring, 8 bytes payload).

Snapshots are written to a single file with no framing; readers
parse the entire file as one `Snapshot` record.

## 7. The Sign-Input Encoding (§8.8.5)

The bytes a signer attests to:

```
signInput(action, signer, nonce, deploymentId) :=
  CBE-bytestring("legalkernel/v1/signedaction") ++
  CBE-bytestring(deploymentId) ++
  CBE(action) ++
  CBE-uint(signer) ++
  CBE-uint(nonce)
```

The domain string `"legalkernel/v1/signedaction"` is 27 ASCII
bytes; its CBE-bytestring form is `0x02 :: <0x1B 0x00 0x00 0x00
0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00> :: <27 bytes>` = 36 bytes.  The deployment ID
is the genesis state hash (8 bytes for FNV-1a-64; 32 bytes for
BLAKE3-256).

Production deployments hash the resulting bytes with BLAKE3-256
(or whatever hash the `Verify` adaptor expects) and pass the
digest to `Verify`.  The Phase-5 stub passes the bytes themselves
(since `Verify` is opaque at the Lean level).

## 8. The Runtime CLI (`canon`) ABI

The `canon` binary exposes five subcommands:

```
canon info
canon process     LOG IN [OUT]
canon replay      LOG
canon bootstrap   LOG
canon snapshot    LOG SNAP_PATH
canon help
```

Argument semantics:

  * `LOG`        — path to the append-only log file.
  * `IN`         — path to a binary file of concatenated
                   `SignedAction` CBE records (no framing —
                   each record's CBE encoding terminates exactly
                   at the next record's start).
  * `OUT`        — optional; path to write the final 8-byte LE
                   `ContentHash`.
  * `SNAP_PATH`  — path to write the `Snapshot` encoding.

Exit codes:

  * `0` — success.
  * `1` — runtime error (bootstrap failed, parse error, replay
          failed, etc.).
  * `2` — argument error (unrecognised subcommand).

Output format (stdout):

  * `canon info` — three lines: name, build tag, phase tag.
  * `canon process` — bootstrap diagnostic, then one line per
    processed action (`[idx] OK (n events)` or `[idx] FAIL
    (<error>)`), then `final state hash: <hex>`, then optionally
    a confirmation line if `OUT` was provided.
  * `canon replay` — one line `parsed N entries`, then either
    `final state hash: <hex>` on success or `replay failed:
    <repr>` on stderr with exit 1.
  * `canon bootstrap` — diagnostic block including log index,
    prev hash, state hash; optionally a `warning: truncated
    partial tail` line on stderr when the log was torn.
  * `canon snapshot` — diagnostic block including state hash, log
    index, and confirmation of the snapshot file write.

## 9. The Replay CLI (`canon-replay`) ABI

```
canon-replay LOG [SNAPSHOT]
```

Output format (one or two lines):

  * `OK <16-hex-chars>` on a clean replay.  (For BLAKE3-256 in
    production, the hash is 64 hex chars.)
  * `REPLAY_ERROR <repr>` on a replay-time failure.
  * `SNAPSHOT_ERROR <repr>` when a requested snapshot fails to
    restore (decoded but `stateHash` did not match the recomputed
    hash, etc.).
  * `SNAPSHOT_DECODE_ERROR <repr>` when the snapshot bytes don't
    parse (corrupt / truncated / wrong type / missing file).
  * `LOG_TRUNCATED entries=<count>` (info line, written before
    the success / error line) when the log file had a partial
    tail; replay still proceeds against the recovered prefix.

**Security contract.**  The tool refuses to print an `OK <hash>`
line when a requested snapshot fails to restore.  Earlier drafts
silently fell back to the empty genesis state, producing a
hash-of-empty-state line that masked the snapshot failure.  The
current implementation exits 1 without proceeding to replay if the
snapshot was requested but cannot be recovered.

Exit codes: `0` on `OK`, `1` on any failure (snapshot or replay).

## 10. Future Network ABI (WU 5.4 placeholder)

When the Rust network adaptor lands, it will expose:

  * **Wire format**: a length-prefixed `SignedAction` CBE record
    over TCP, followed by a single `Verdict`-style response byte
    (0 for OK, 1 for `notAdmissible`, 2 for parse error).
  * **Unix socket protocol**: the runtime listens on a
    deployment-configurable Unix socket path; the Rust adaptor
    relays incoming TCP requests through it.
  * **Authentication**: the Rust adaptor enforces TLS at the TCP
    boundary; the Unix socket is filesystem-permission-protected.

This section will be expanded in the WU 5.4 follow-up PR.
