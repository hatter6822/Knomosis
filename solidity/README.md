# Canon Solidity contracts

L1 mirror of Canon's kernel: ten immutable contracts plus five
shared libraries that anchor deposits, state-root submissions,
withdrawals, the dispute pipeline, sequencer staking, interactive
fault proofs (Workstream H), and the attested-handoff migration
mechanism.

The full design rationale lives in
[`docs/planning/ethereum_integration_plan.md`](../docs/planning/ethereum_integration_plan.md)
§9 (Workstream E) and §20 (immutability amendment); the fault-proof
layer is specified in
[`docs/planning/fault_proof_migration_plan.md`](../docs/planning/fault_proof_migration_plan.md)
and motivated in
[`docs/fault_proof_design.md`](../docs/fault_proof_design.md). Read
those first; this README is the day-to-day developer guide.

```

Total: **~340 forge tests across 24 suites** (per-suite counts in
each `*.t.sol`). A subset is conditionally skipped when the
production keccak256 binding is not linked (the cross-check
suites probe `isKeccak256Linked` on the Lean side and skip on
the fallback).

## Build & test

```bash
# Install Foundry (one-time):
curl -sSfL https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/releases/download/v1.7.0/foundry_v1.7.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz \
  -o /tmp/foundry.tar.gz
tar xzf /tmp/foundry.tar.gz -C /usr/local/foundry/bin
export PATH="/usr/local/foundry/bin:$PATH"

# Install solc 0.8.20 (one-time):
curl -sSfL https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/download/v0.8.20/solc-static-linux \
  -o /usr/local/bin/solc
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/solc

# Vendor OpenZeppelin v5.0.2 + forge-std v1.9.4 (run from this dir):
./scripts/vendor-deps.sh

# Build + test:
forge build
forge test
make test-cross-stack             # CrossCheck/ only
make testnet-acceptance-dryrun    # F.3 testnet acceptance dry-run
```

`foundry.toml` pins:

* `solc_version = "0.8.20"` with `evm_version = "shanghai"`.
* `via_ir = true` — required because `CanonBridge.withdrawWithProof`
  and a few other functions are stack-too-deep without it.
* `optimizer_runs = 200`.

## Immutability discipline

Per §4.8 / §20 of the integration plan, every contract here is
deployed immutably:

* **No proxy.** Each contract goes straight to its final address
  (mainnet via `CREATE2` with deterministic salts; tests via
  `CREATE3` to break cyclic references between bridge, verifier,
  stake, and the fault-proof game).
* **No `initialize`.** Constructors set every field; nothing is
  later mutable.
* **No admin role.** Each cross-contract authority is encoded as
  `address public immutable`.
* **No `pause()` function.** Whole-system halts use the automatic
  circuit breakers in `CanonBridge.sol` (§9.1.4): `AttestationStale`,
  `DisputeCooldown`, `TvlCapReached`, `MigrationActivated`. Each
  fires on a deterministic public-state predicate; no privileged
  caller is involved.
* **Recovery via the dispute pipeline, not via code.** Bad state
  transitions are reverted by upheld disputes or by the fault-proof
  game; bad code is replaced by deploying a new immutable contract
  and using `CanonMigration` / `CanonFaultProofMigration` to attest
  the handoff.

The forge test suite includes a `test_no_admin_surface` assertion
on every contract that confirms canonical admin selectors
(`pause()`, `unpause()`, `transferOwnership(...)`, `grantRole(...)`,
`upgradeTo(...)`) are not callable.

## CREATE3 deployment

The bridge ↔ verifier ↔ stake ↔ fault-proof-game cycle is broken
at deployment time using `CREATE3` (`src/lib/CREATE3.sol`), which
derives each contract's address from `(deployer, salt)` alone —
independent of init-code. This lets the predicted addresses be
baked into each contract's `immutable` constructor arguments before
deployment.

The standard CREATE3 proxy (init-code
`0x67363d3d37363d34f03d5260086018f3`) does not propagate inner
constructor reverts: a failed inner CREATE returns 0 from the
proxy, and the `deploy` helper detects that via a post-deploy
`code.length == 0` check. This is the documented behaviour of
every standard CREATE3 implementation (Solady, Solmate).
Production deployment scripts that need bubbled revert reasons
must use a bespoke proxy; the `CanonMigration` test fixtures use
direct `new ...(...)` deployment so constructor revert reasons
propagate verbatim.

## Cross-stack equivalence

Per Workstream F.1, the Solidity contracts must produce
byte-identical results to the Lean reference implementation.
Specifically:

* `CBEDecode` decodes byte-for-byte the same way as
  `LegalKernel.Encoding.cborHeadDecode`.
* `SmtVerifier.verifyProof` accepts exactly the same proofs as
  `LegalKernel.Bridge.WithdrawalRoot.verifyProof`.
* `CanonEip712`'s digest matches `LegalKernel.Bridge.Eip712.digest`.
* `CanonBridge`'s `receiptHash` derivation matches
  `LegalKernel.Laws.Deposit.depositId`.
* `CanonStepVM.executeStep` matches
  `LegalKernel.FaultProof.Step.kernelStep` byte-for-byte (H).
* `CanonFaultProofGame` state transitions match
  `LegalKernel.FaultProof.Game` (H).

The Lean side (`LegalKernel/Test/Bridge/CrossCheck/*` and
`LegalKernel/Test/FaultProof/CrossCheck/*`) generates JSON fixtures
across seven Workstream-F sub-suites plus three Workstream-H
sub-suites. The Solidity side (`solidity/test/CrossCheck/*`)
consumes the fixtures via `vm.readFile` + `vm.parseJson` and
asserts byte equality against the recorded Lean outputs. Per-entry
assertions are gated on the production keccak256 binding being
linked (`isKeccak256Linked`); when running with the FNV fallback
the cross-checks log a skip line and exit cleanly.

To regenerate fixtures (Lean side):

```bash
CANON_FIXTURES_OVERWRITE=1 lake test
```

This writes updated fixtures under
`solidity/test/CrossCheck/fixtures/`.

## Workstream E contracts (E.1 – E.5)

### `CanonBridge.sol` (E.1)

The L1 escrow for deposits and withdrawals.

| WU    | Function                                             |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------|
| E.1.1 | `depositETH()` / `depositERC20(...)` — deposit entry |
| E.1.2 | `submitStateRoot(...)` — attestor-signed state root  |
| E.1.3 | `withdrawWithProof(...)` — proof-gated redemption    |
| E.1.4 | `circuitOpen` modifier — automatic state-driven halt |
| E.1.5 | `revertToPriorRoot(...)` — dispute-triggered rollback |

### `CanonDisputeVerifier.sol` (E.2)

The v1 L1 dispute pipeline. Three claim variants ship in MVP
(mirroring the Lean `Disputes.Evidence` machinery):

| WU    | Variant                                                      |
|-------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| E.2.1 | `fileDispute(...)` + CBE-decode helper library               |
| E.2.2 | `checkSignatureInvalid(...)` — re-runs ECDSA recovery        |
| E.2.3 | `checkNonceMismatch(...)` — replays log prefix nonce-only    |
| E.2.4 | `checkDoubleApply(...)` — `(signer, nonce)` collision check  |
| E.2.5 | `finalizeUpheld(...)` — quorum + slash + rollback            |

`preconditionFalse` and `oracleMisreported` are deferred to v2;
adding them requires a new dispute-verifier deployment + migration.

### `CanonIdentityRegistry.sol` (E.3)

Mirror of the Lean `KeyRegistry` (Authority/Identity.lean). Two
register entry points: `registerECDSA` for EOAs (verifies
`keccak256(pubkey)[12:] == msg.sender` for front-running
protection); `registerEIP1271` for contract signers (probes
`isValidSignature(bytes32(0), "")` for the canonical magic /
explicit-invalid response).

### `CanonSequencerStake.sol` (E.4)

The sequencer's ETH stake escrow. Slashed by the dispute verifier
on `.upheld` finalisation: `slashRatioBps * stake / 10_000` goes
to the challenger; the residual is sent to the immutable burn
address. Withdrawal lock-up enforced via the bridge's
`hasOpenDisputeOlderThan` getter.

### `CanonMigration.sol` (E.5)

The one-shot, attested handoff between a predecessor and a
successor `CanonBridge`. Replaces the upgradeable-proxy mechanism
that other rollup designs use for code-level recovery.

* `MIN_GRACE_WINDOW_BLOCKS = 216_000` (≈ 30 days @ 12s blocks) —
  a Solidity `constant` baked into the bytecode; cannot be
  weakened by any constructor argument.
* Constructor verifies the predecessor's attestor's ECDSA
  signature over the canonical EIP-712 wrap of the migration
  record.
* Bidirectional consent: constructor asserts
  `predecessor.migration() == address(this)` (the predecessor
  freezes post-activation; the successor remains operational so
  users can interact with it).
* `activated` is one-way; once `true`, never reverts.
* Anyone can call `activate()` after the grace window — no role
  gating.

## Workstream H contracts (fault-proof migration)

Workstream H adds interactive fault proofs as a stronger
alternative to the v1 bot-quorum dispute model. The trust
assumption tightens from "M-of-N bots honest" to
"1-of-anyone honest". The Lean specification lives in
`LegalKernel/FaultProof/`; the operator-facing material is in
[`docs/fault_proof_runbook.md`](../docs/fault_proof_runbook.md).

### `CanonStepVM.sol`

The pure, stateless single-step verifier. Given a kernel sub-state
and a signed action, returns the canonical post sub-state. Mirrors
`LegalKernel.FaultProof.Step.kernelStep` byte-for-byte (cross-stack
fixture: `solidity/test/CrossCheck/StepVM.t.sol`).

### `CanonStateRootSubmission.sol`

The L1 state-root window. Sequencers post `(stateCommit, bond)`
records; bonds release after the dispute window if no fault proof
unseats them, or get slashed (95% to challenger, 5% to treasury)
if a fault proof wins. Rate-limited via `MIN_SUBMISSION_INTERVAL_BLOCKS`
and bounded by `outstandingRootsCount[sequencer]`.

### `CanonFaultProofGame.sol`

The on-chain bisection-game arbiter. Manages dispute rounds:
challenger and sequencer alternate `respond(hash)` calls,
narrowing the disputed interval by 2× each round until they
disagree on a single step. The arbiter then asks `CanonStepVM`
to recompute that step and declares the loser. Tracks per-game
bonds; settles `winnerTakesBond` on conclusion.

### `CanonDisputeVerifierV2.sol`

The v2 dispute pipeline. Adds a fifth claim variant
(`faultProofWon`) that lets an upheld fault-proof game directly
trigger a rollback in `CanonStateRootSubmission`, bypassing the
v1 adjudicator-quorum requirement.

### `CanonFaultProofMigration.sol`

The v1 → v2 migration contract. Same attested-handoff pattern as
`CanonMigration` but tailored for moving from the
`CanonDisputeVerifier` (v1) + `CanonBridge` deployment to the
`CanonDisputeVerifierV2` + `CanonStateRootSubmission` +
`CanonFaultProofGame` + `CanonStepVM` quartet.

## Production deployment notes

* Use `CREATE3` for all cyclic contracts so cross-references resolve
  to predictable addresses.
* The bridge's `migration` immutable should be set to a *predicted*
  `CanonMigration` `CREATE3` address at predecessor deployment time.
  At the initial deployment the predicted address can be
  `address(0)` (no migration planned); future deployments override.
* Run `forge test` on the deployment artefacts as a smoke check
  before proposing on-chain.
* The "no admin surface" assertion in F.3 (testnet acceptance)
  doubles as a safety check that no upgradeable-proxy bytecode has
  accidentally crept in.
* For Workstream-H deployment ordering, sequence is:
  `CanonStepVM → CanonStateRootSubmission → CanonFaultProofGame →
  CanonDisputeVerifierV2 → CanonFaultProofMigration` (see
  `docs/fault_proof_runbook.md` §2).

## Future: actor-scoped policies (Workstream LP)

Workstream LP (actor-scoped policies) is complete on the Lean side
but the Solidity-side mirror is **not yet implemented**. When
landed, it will require:

  1. A CBE decoder in `solidity/src/lib/CBEDecode.sol` for the
     `LocalPolicy` and `LocalPolicyClause` types, mirroring the
     Lean codec line-for-line with the same DoS bounds
     (`MAX_CLAUSES_PER_POLICY = 64`,
     `MAX_TAGS_PER_DENY = 64`,
     `MAX_RECIPIENTS_PER_REQUIRE = 64`,
     `MAX_POLICY_ENCODE_BYTES = 16_384`).
  2. An admissibility-check call in
     `CanonBridge.depositETH` / `depositERC20` that consults the
     depositor's L2 `localPolicies` lookup before crediting
     (defensive layer; the L2 admissibility check already enforces
     this — the Solidity-side check is for fast L1 user feedback).
  3. Two new event-listener mappings for `LocalPolicyDeclared` /
     `LocalPolicyRevoked` in the indexer.

A future `CanonDisputeVerifier` extension may add a sixth claim
variant (`localPolicyMisreported`) for adjudicating disputes about
whether a particular L2 transaction violated the actor's declared
policy. See
[`docs/planning/actor_scoped_policies_plan.md`](../docs/planning/actor_scoped_policies_plan.md)
for the full engineering plan and
[`docs/abi.md`](../docs/abi.md) §5.4 for the canonical on-disk byte
layouts.
